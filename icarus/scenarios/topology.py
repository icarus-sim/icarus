"""Functions for creating or importing topologies for experiments.

To create a custom topology, create a function returning an instance of the
`IcnTopology` class. An IcnTopology is simply a subclass of a Topology class
provided by FNSS.

A valid ICN topology must have the following attributes:
 * Each node must have one stack among: source, receiver, router
 * The topology must have an attribute called `icr_candidates` which is a set
   of router nodes on which a cache may be possibly deployed. Caches are not
   deployed directly at topology creation, instead they are deployed by a
   cache placement algorithm.
