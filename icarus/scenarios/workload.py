"""Traffic workloads

Every traffic workload to be used with Icarus must be modelled as an iterable
class, i.e. a class with at least an `__init__` method (through which it is
initialized, with values taken from the configuration file) and an `__iter__`
method that is called to return a new event.

Each call to the `__iter__` method must return a 2-tuple in which the first
element is the timestamp at which the event occurs and the second is a
dictionary, describing the event, which must contain at least the three
following attributes:
 * receiver: The name of the node issuing the request
 * content: The name of the content for which the request is issued
 * log: A boolean value indicating whether this request should be logged or not
   for measurement purposes.

Each workload must expose the `contents` attribute which is an iterable of
all content identifiers. This is needed for content placement.

    """This function generates events on the fly, i.e. instead of creating an
    event schedule to be kept in memory, returns an iterator that generates
    events when needed.

    This is useful for running large schedules of events where RAM is limited
    as its memory impact is considerably lower.

    These requests are Poisson-distributed while content popularity is
    Zipf-distributed

    All requests are mapped to receivers uniformly unless a positive *beta*
    parameter is specified.

    If a *beta* parameter is specified, then receivers issue requests at
    different rates. The algorithm used to determine the requests rates for
    each receiver is the following:
     * All receiver are sorted in decreasing order of degree of the PoP they
       are attached to. This assumes that all receivers have degree = 1 and are
       attached to a node with degree > 1
     * Rates are then assigned following a Zipf distribution of coefficient
       beta where nodes with higher-degree PoPs have a higher request rate

    Parameters
    ----------
    topology : fnss.Topology

    n_contents : int

    n_measured : int, optional

        Iterator of events. Each event is a 2-tuple where the first element is
        the timestamp at which the event occurs and the second element is a
